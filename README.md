# 📦 Hyperlocal Delivery Platform Database (Zepto Clone) – Full SQL Server Project

## 🛒 Overview

This project builds a **real-world SQL Server Database** backend for a **Hyperlocal Delivery System** like **Zepto**, **Blinkit**, or **Dunzo**.

You will learn how to **design**, **build**, **optimize**, **secure**, and **automate** a full production-like database from scratch — a perfect real-world project for your resume or interviews! 🚀

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a scalable and normalized database structure
- Insert real-world sample data (users, vendors, products, orders)
- Write powerful SQL queries for business analytics
- Create Views, Indexes, Triggers, and Stored Procedures
- Optimize database performance
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Automate daily tasks with SQL Server Agent Jobs
- Send scheduled notifications (like Zomato reminders)
